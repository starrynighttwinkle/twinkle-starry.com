    <h3>1. WHAT ARE THE 5 THINGS THAT I REMEMBER DURING MY CHILDHOOD?</h3>
<center><img src="child.jpg" height="350"/></center>
<p>1.  During my elementary days, I remember buying different school materials such as a pink stroller bag, crayons, notebooks with cartoon character prints, colorful umbrellas, lunchbox, and many more. I also buy toys like barbie dolls, loombands, cards also known as teks and pogs, and yoyo.</p>


<p>2. When I was a child, I still remember going to my neighbor’s house to watch cartoons such as wonder pets, ben ten, Spongebob, Tom & Jerry, Doraemon, Oggy & the cockroaches, and many more. I also remember memorizing the television advertisement lines together with my cousins.</p>
 

<p>3. During my childhood days, one of my best memories is playing different larong kalye or street games. I always played different street games such as patintero, tumbang preso, limbo rock, Chinese garter, and many more with the other children in my neighborhood. I also remember our mothers getting angry at us when we played until evening.</p>


<p>4. When I was a little child, simple things made me so much happy like eating my favorite foods. I still remember being so happy whenever there is an occasion in our house or my neighborhood because that means that I will be able to eat foods such as spaghetti, pancit, hotdogs with marshmallows, and other party foods. I am also happy when there is an occasion because that would also be a mini family reunion.</p>


<p>5. Just like any other child, I am extremely happy during the summer vacation. Why? Because during summer vacation I and my family always have a trip to other places. I still remember going to the beach, I still enjoy it even though I don’t know how to swim. And of course, the food at the beach is the best.</p>

<h3>2. WHO WILL I BE AFTER 5 YEARS?</h3>
<center><img src="dream.jpg" height="200"/></center>
                         <p>Most of us believe that everything is uncertain. We merely have clue on what will happen in the future, but most of us are still determined to achieve the future that we want and make it come true. Just like everyone else, I am determined enough that I will reach my goals five years from now.</p>

                         <p>Five years from now, I perceive myself as happy and contented with what I have and what I do for a living. After five years, I am already a college graduate. I have already reached one of my goals in life which is to earn a degree in Psychology. I see myself as a professional in Industrial psychology and I also see myself as a successful individual in the business industry. I am already an independent woman having my own savings account and paying my families’ bills. I am already able to buy my wants and needs also the things that my mother always wanted to have. Five years from now, I am already starting to travel to the places that I want. Though I already have work and some money, I still manage to save and invest for my future. In that way, I will be able to secure any financial problems. Moreover, If given a chance and if I had enough courage, I also see myself studying in law school which is my ultimate dream since then.</p> 

                         <p>The future may be uncertain for now but with enough courage and determination, I will make all of these things happen. I believe that all of these goals will come true if I will start working on them now while I am still young. I strongly believe that a positive mindset and faith will lead me to my dreams in five years.</p>
